<h3>Project Objective</h3>
<p>The objective of this project is to ingest, transform, analysis, and visualize the data to make resilient data processing and high accuracy analytical data. The pipeline should be designed to handle large amounts of data and ensure data integrity during the data processing. The pipeline should include steps for extracting data from the data source (BMKG), loading data into datalake (AWS S3 Bucket), transforming into data warehouse (Snowflake), doing some analysis on it, and finally build data visualization to get more insight. </p>
